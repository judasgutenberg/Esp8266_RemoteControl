# Esp8266 Remote, Automation, and Environmental Logging
## Overview
If you need complete control of all the code of a robust multi-user/multi-tenant remote-control, automation and weather data logging system without infuriating compilation and dependency headaches (in Javascript or PHP), you might be interested in this system. I developed it to more efficiently use solar energy at my off-grid Adirondack cabin while also keeping the internet accessible and the pipes from freezing.  This started out as a simple multi-probe weather monitoring system (<a href=https://github.com/judasgutenberg/ESP8266-Micro-Weather target=esp>ESP8266 MicroWeather</a>) to which I first added reliability automation (<a href=https://github.com/judasgutenberg/Hotspot-Watchdog  target=hot>Hotspot-Watchdog</a>), then remote control, then solar inverter monitoring, then cabin automation, and finally a multi-tenant security model (so others can use the same server installation as a backend).  

For monitoring multiple weather sensors (placed, say, in various places inside and outside a building), there's a multi-plot graph.

There's also a page to show data from your solar inverter if you happen to be using the one I know about (SolArk), which can be logged either from the cloud via an API or from a special <a href=https://github.com/judasgutenberg/SolArk_Copilot targtet=solark>SolArk Copilot</a> attached directly to the inverter:

But the main feature in this system is that it allows you to remotely control devices across the internet and also supports automation based on the values of sensors known to the central database.  It does this using a server reachable via the internet running PHP/MySQL.  There is no server-side or Javascript compilation and relatively few dependencies:  PHP, MySQL, APCu, the Chart.js 3.7 graphing library, and a variety of Arduino sensor libraries, so this is not much trouble to get working on just about any server where you have a reasonable amount of control.

A web-based tool (tool.php) allows you to edit the value column of a table called device_feature, where device_id is equal to device_id specified in config.c in the Arduino-compiled code (remote.ino, config.h, config.c, and index.h) uploaded to your ESP8266 device.  Once installed on the ESP8266, it regularly polls the server (make sure to set host_get in config.c before compiling) to look for information in those device_feature records, and it automatically copies data from the value column to the pins they're connected to (which is specified in device_type_feature).  These pins can then be used to turn on relays, which allow you to control potentially large loads in remote locations. I'm using this system to remotely turn on the boiler, hot water heater, a 240 volt EV outlet, a 240 volt dual-zone minisplit, and three different 120 volt outlets connected to electric space heaters in my off-grid cabin.  Obviously, this involves working with dangerous voltage, so if you don't know anything about electrical wiring and basic safety with such things, you should instead use this to control low-voltage gizmos like battery-powered radios, toy motors, or LEDs.

Device_features can also be sensors reachable by a GPIO pin or I2C, and if multiple sensors are attached to an ESP8266, the additional ones will be identified by device_feature_id if they were created in the backend.

One caveat: this system is one where the server tells the microcontroller what pins do what and it can change assignments without a need to reflash or to even restart the microcontroller. For some pins (notably GPIO10 and GPIO9 on an ESP8266, which are used for accessing on-board flash storage), setting them to outputs and forcing them to take a value will cause the ESP8266 to crash and restart. So be sure to properly test all your pin control arrangements while local to the ESP8266 before using it remotely.

To expand the number of pins available for remote control, you can add one or more slave Arduinos running my slave software (be sure to give them all different I2C addresses, which is a small code tweak to the Slave Arduino firmware):
[https://github.com/judasgutenberg/Generic_Arduino_I2C_Slave](https://github.com/judasgutenberg/Arduino_I2C_Slave_With_Commands) and just add the I2C address of the slave Arduino to the device_type_feature record. Arduinos based on Atmega328s, Atmega168s, Atmega8s, Atmega32Us, and even LGT8F328P are ideal for use as slaves since they will not generally participate in slave uprisings.

## Design Philosophy
This repository showcases my design philosphy, which is highly practical and uninterested in trends and styles unless they have concrete benefits that clearly outweigh their costs.  I wanted to minimize dependency on other projects to avoid the introduction of such distractions as compilation, dependency incompatibility, distressingly-enormous storage requirements, and the evolutionary drift of APIs.  Obviously, one can go too far with this attitude, thus the goal in this repo was to strike a balance between struggling to orchestrate numerous modules created by others and reinventing all the components myself.  So this repo uses PHP, MySQL, Javascript (the particular versions don't much matter), Chart.js, the Arduino IDE, several non-hardware Arduino libraries, and the Arduino libraries for various common sensors. It does not, however, use any frontend or backend frameworks, as all of those introduce thick, brittle layers of dependencies, which can take days for someone new to the codebase to coax into life. (I'm a professional software developer with decades of experience, and there are many hours I've lost to this.) 

Given all that, in this repository, all of the login, database access, and web rendering code (with the exception of the Chart.js code) is self-contained within this repo.  I've used pieces of it elsewhere (for example, in my <a href=https://github.com/judasgutenberg/networked_spellingbee target=nsb>Networked Spelling Bee repository</a>), so technically it <em>is</em> a sort of framework, though one I've felt no urge to release as a separate project, since it doesn't aspire to be a framework.  This means there is no compilation of Javascript or PHP. If you need to make changes, you just change the source files, since they are also the object files.  I've found this is my preferred way to work on client/server code, as compilation creates a distraction big enough to negatively affect creativity and productivity.  Obviously, the code on the ESP8266s must be compiled in the Arduino environment, but I've become comfortable with that workflow, especially since other distractions aren't present (such as copying files to a server or clearing caches) and the compilation of code for microcontrollers generally goes quickly. 

This code uses a mix of server-side and client-side rendering of display elements, depending on which method is appropriate. Some components (such as the graphs output for weather and inverter data) use modern single-page techniques in vanilla Javascript, though in many places it makes more sense to render HTML in the backend and to provide conventional navigation between the pages.  Often the HTML in such pages is later modified by Javascript to keep it in sync with changing data in the backend. When you aren't working in someone else's framework, you can make things behave in precisely nuanced ways without having to build your own framework on top of it (anyone who has tried to implement unusual systems in a framework knows what I mean).

Another important philosophy is that I want to support older hardware with my code, especially in the web client.  Not only do I have a fondness for old Espressif microcontrollers, but I love old Chromebooks, the kind that kids might've been using in school well before the pandemic. I have a eight or nine of them in various places, and they typically cost $40.  They have all the advantages of a tablet, yet they also have a physical keyboard. And they're disposable enough for me to use in the tub (where I've never yet lost one). But I hate it when a website (yes you, Reddit!) tells me that my Chromebook is no longer supported, especially given how easy it is to provide support.  (In my code, the only change I've had to make was to stop using fetch(), the chaining operator, and the Javascript replaceChildren() method.)  If you're insisting on using all the latest Javascript methods and constantly raising alerts telling your users to "upgrade," what you're really saying is that landfills don't contain nearly enough eWaste. Solark's dashboard was one of the offenders, and it's great to have completely replaced that with the energy tab in this application.

I prefer my code to be as straightforward as possible. I don't, for example, appreciate clever one-line solutions to programming challenges and prefer to use explicit loops where it is obvious to as many viewers as possible what precisely is going on.  Similarly, I prefer an imperative over a declarative coding style, and I've never been enamored with an object-oriented approach, particularly for cases where it just gets in the way.  This is not to say this code contains none of those things, but it's not a showcase for any particular coding paradigm and certainly doesn't aspire to be fashionable.

Obviously, if one insists on making all their own database access and login methods, there is a strong possibility of security vulnerabilities creeping into the design. I'm aware of most of these, though it's possible I've overlooked something.  (It's open source, so feel free to make pull requests!)  My reporting system gives immense powers to super users, for example, but that's something I personally need and would have difficulty working without. And it's easy enough not to give access to report writing (or even execution) to your users under this system.

One final thing I'd like to mention regarding my philosophy concerns apps, the things that you find yourself constantly installing on your smart phone. I hate them. They frequently have names and icons unrelated to their function, and it's unlikely you use any one app very often. But when you do need to use one, you've forgotten what app it was that you need to do the rare thing you need to do. For example, back before I realized how terrible apps were, I made the mistake of buying a smart bulb at Home Depot.  To control that smart bulb, I had to install an app named "Wiz" on my phone.  But I almost never turn that lightbulb on, because I'm not the sort of person who keeps my phone close by me at all times.  Meanwhile, that lightbulb cannot remember its state through a power outage, which is something that happens once every two months or so where I live. So when the power comes back on after such an outage, that stupid smart bulb is shining brightly, and my wife wants to know how to turn the damn thing off.  The only way to do that is with that app on my phone, but it's been two months and I've forgotten what the name of the app is.  A more open approach to controlling devices like that is to provide an interface on a web page.  Then I can use any web browser to control it and I can remember where to go by either storing a bookmark or saving a url in a text file.  Not only that, but any device controllable by a web interface has an API that is revealed by the nature of how the web communicates and can often be transplanted elsewhere, perhaps to be placed on a custom dashboard, possibly a web page where you could control all your devices in one place instead of across an archipelago of shouty apps with wildly different user interfaces constantly nagging to be updated.  By contrast, an app can successfully lock away your data and not give you access to it (either holding it hostage to better monetize it or because it assumes you are too ignorant to make use of it).  This is why I have not made an native app for the system described here (although you can get much of that functionality with feature.php if you so choose).

## Hardware Setup
This system expects an ESP-8266-based device programmed in the Ardunio environment to be able to control the systems that need to be turned on or off.  I've had success connecting a NodeMCU to a ULN2003 and having that switch 12 volt power to 12 volt relays capable of switching enormous loads.   See the schematic for how I connected seven relays using both a NodeMCU and an Arduino Mini running at 3.3 volts that I flashed with <a href=https://github.com/judasgutenberg/Generic_Arduino_I2C_Slave target=arduino>my Arduino Slave firmware</a>.  To see other examples of the ULN2003 used, see (for example) [https://microcontrollerslab.com/relay-driver-circuit-using-uln2003/](https://www.engineersgarage.com/driving-relays-with-stm32-microcontroller/).  Most of the sensors I currently support are connected via I2C, although I also support DHT sensors, which require even fewer pins to connect.  If you attach a slave Arduino running my "slave with commands" capability (https://github.com/judasgutenberg/Arduino_I2C_Slave_With_Commands), the slave can serve as a hardware watchdog to reboot the master if it isn't "petted" frequently enough.  In that case, you will need to specify this in config.c.

## Arduino Setup
Some of the files (remote.ino, config.h, config.c, and index.h) are designed to be compiled in the Arduino environment and then uploaded to an ESP8266. (I used a NodeMCU, which is cheap, reasonably small, and has conveniently-gendered pins making it easy to work with.)  The Arduino code is designed to be able to handle a diverse collection of common sensors with the ability to dynamically change sensor types without requiring a recompilation or even a restart.  This requires, of course, that the libraries for these devices are all installed at compilation time.  Currently, the device libraries are as follows:
<ul>
<li>Adafruit DHT, a temperature/humidity sensor: (https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/dht-sensor-library/)
<li>Adafruit AHT, a temperature/humidity sensor: (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_AHTX0)
<li>Adafruit BMP085, a temperature/air-pressure sensor: (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-BMP085-Library)
<li>BME680, a temperature/air-pressure/humidity sensor: (https://github.com/Zanduino/BME680/blob/master/src/Zanshin_BME680.h)
<li>BMP180, a temperature/air-pressure sensor: (https://github.com/LowPowerLab/SFE_BMP180)
<li>LM75, a temperature sensor: (https://github.com/jeremycole/Temperature_LM75_Derived)
<li>Adafruit BMP280, a temperature/air-pressure sensor: (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_BMP280_Library/blob/master/Adafruit_BMP280.h)
</ul>
This system also requires a number of external libraries:
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson
<li>https://github.com/arduino-libraries/NTPClient
<li>https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/blob/master/libraries/ESP8266WiFi/src/WiFiUdp.h
<li>https://github.com/spacehuhn/SimpleMap
</ul> 


## Server Setup
The rest of the code needs to be placed on a server that can process PHP pages and communicate with a MySQL database that you create and control. (It's not an elegant language, but I like PHP because it runs pretty well and doesn't require compilation or setup headaches on most servers or Raspberry Pis.) 

To get this installed, first create an initial database by running remote_control.sql on the server and then change config.php so the PHP will know how to connect to the database.  You then create a tenant and a user connected to that tenant via tenant_user and give that tenant a storage_password so that the ESP8266 will be able to authenticate communication with the backend (all this can be done under the tenant tab in the web UI if your user has 'super' status).  This storage password is then set as storage_password (along with other important config information like your WiFi credentials and the domain and path where your backend is hosted) in config.c before compiling the Arduino code and uploading it to an ESP8266.  Then you create a device and give it device_features, and set the device_id of the ESP8266 to the device_id of that device in config.c so that the backend will know which ESP8266 is polling to log sensor data and perhaps pick up remote control settings and additional sensors.

Now you need to create a new account with the web front end. The first user in the database is automatically given the role of super, which can edit the user table, create reports, and administer other tenants in the database, among other privileges.  That user also automatically gets a tenant, connected to the user via the tenant_user table.  Superusers can manage the connection of tenants to users via the user or tenant editors.  Users who need tenants can either ask the superuser to connect them to their tenant or new users can be invited to join their tenant by using a special link (which can be produced by one of the utilities in the Utilities tab).  

From there, here's an overview of how to set up control for a particular system controlled by a pin on your ESP8266:

1. Add a record to the device table to represent your particular ESP8266.  In the code, device_id and location_id refer to the same entity. Your ESP8266 will send that id as device_id to the server whenever it polls it to get updates on what values the device with its pins should have.  You will need to set device_id to this value in config.c before compiling the code for you ESP8266.
2. Add a record to the device_type table describing your particular type of device (in this case, ESP8266).  Values for most of the fields don't matter much.
3. Add a record to the device_type_feature table describing the pin (mostly the pin number and, if it is on an Arduino slave, the I2C address).
4. Add a record to the device_feature table describing the specific pin (here a human readable name would be useful).
5. You can change the state of a particular ESP8266's pin by changing the state of the value column in the device_feature record.  Make sure to set enabled to 1 as well.  Depending on the speed of your network and how frequently you set polling, the change should manifest within 10 to 20 seconds or so.

Here is the user interface, which allows you to turn items on and off in the list by checking the "power on" column. (You do it all from the device_feature list view.)

## Users and Tenants
To login, every user must have credentials in the user table.  Users belong to a tenant, while devices also belong to the tenant.  Users typically can access all the devices belonging to their tenant.   Most other tables relate to tenants so that every tenant has its own unique configuration. When new tenants are first created, they are given a set of related entities (such as weather_conditions, reports, and device_type_features) from a "template" tenant with a tenant_id of 0.  The exact values in this template can vary depending on who is curating it. Typically one tenant is a model tenant and is used as the basis for the template tenant.  There is a utility for copying certain records from any particular tenant to the template tenant. When this is done, the tenant being copied from is said to be the "model" tenant.  At any time any template can have their setup records overwritten with records from the template tenant using another utility, though this is typically only done when a tenant is first created.

## Data Logging
The ESP8266 transmits delimited data in a querystring to the backend at a regular polling interval set in config.c. This data includes temperature, air pressure, humidity, and many other possible weather sensor values, as well as the states of devices being controlled remotely.  It can also transmit positional data from a mobile ESP8266. All of this data is processed by server.php and logged in the device_log table.  If a FRAM or flash I2C memory is attached to the ESP8266 and properly configured in config.c, then logging will be stored locally when the internet cannot be reached and then gradually sent to the backend once the internet reappears.  Depending on the amount of data being stored locally per record, a $6 32K FRAM can hold about 1000 records.  An ESP8266 has no built-in real time clock, so proper timestamping requires access to the internet (at least initially) unless a real time clock is added via I2C and its address specified in config.c.   I use polling instead of other (more responsive) forms of communication (such as sockets) to remain as compatible as possible with Apache while making it possible for data-logging-only devices to spend most of their time asleep.  Theoretically I could add support for sockets in cases where responsiveness is paramount. But just not having to drive to the Adirondacks is responsive enough for me!

![alt text](esp8266-remote.jpg?raw=true)
## Remote Control
The model of remote control this system uses is server-as-truth. Every time a device polls the server, it gets the server's idea of what the state of its features should be.  The device then immediately changes the device features as necessary.  The only exceptions to this behavior are cases where either actions performed on a device's locally-served web page or a Local Remote make changes to a device_feature on the device directly, and this sets a flag telling the device (and the server) that data from the device should flow in the opposite direction, from device to server. In that case server-as-truth is overriden and the server updates its state accordingly using backwards-flowing data.

This system tracks whether or not data makes it to the device that it is sent to via the last_known_device_value and last_known_device_modified columns.  This is important when a remote control action needs to be verified as having happened. Otherwise you end up looking for a change of temperature or power consumption at your off-grid cabin for such confirmation, and that can take a fair amount of time.  I use a string hash table as a very simple database to store this information on the microcontroller, which might be overkill. But the ESP8266 has enough storage and memory to be a little wasteful of resources. Every change of state for a device_feature is logged by the server in the device_feature_log table.

![alt text](reallifecircuit.jpg?raw=true)

In addition to supporting the changing of pin states using a server, this system also implements a local API with two ESP8266-served endpoints (first you have to know its local address, which is being saved in the device table as ip_address). These endpoints are /readLocalData and /writeLocalData. The former gives a JSON object with info about the pins and their current state.  The other accepts three querystring params:  ip_address, id, and on.  ip_address helps with logging what initiated a change. id is usually the pin number, unless it's a pin on a slave Arduino, in which case it is [I2C address of slave].[pin number].  On is just a 1 for on and 0 for off.  Using that second API, you can turn on circuits directly and then the ESP8266 will update the server with the new value information.  This is useful when building a local remote control panel, which was my next development effort.

(see https://github.com/judasgutenberg/Local_Remote)

index.h has the HTML for a locally-served front-end to take advantage of the local API, though the Local Remote is better for this than relying on the massive computational overhead of a modern web browser. It would also be easy to write a phone app, which would be great for someone who always keeps a phone nearby. But I am not such a person.  

## Microcontroller-Backend Communication
Each microcontroller regularly polls the backend, starting when it boots up.  Every time it polls the backend, it tells the backend what it knows about its state, particularly the values of its sensors, the state of any device_features it has, and the last command_id and command_log_id it has processed. Initially the microcontroller retrieves the information it needs to know more about itself. From then on, it is mostly receiving updates about the states of its device_features, which are usually the same from one polling to the next. Occasionally there will be a command found in the command_log that lacks a result_recorded timestamp, and this will be sent instead of the usual device_feature data.  The microcontroller will then perform the command and transmit any result back to the backend, which will either send any additional unprocessed commands or go back to sending device_feature updates.  Two commands, <b>reboot</b> and <b>watchdog reboot</b>, cannot be processed immediately, as that would cause the microcontroller to reboot and fail to acknowledge receipt of the command. So reboot is deferred until just after its receipt is acknowledged.  (Potentially other commands could be deferred in this same way.)

## Meshtastic Integration
I needed to be able to track my dog Charlotte at the Adirondack cabin, an environment with poor cell coverage.  So I set up a Meshtastic mesh and needed to get it to send data to my backend.  To do this, I created a Meshtastic bridge using a Raspberry Pi Zero W and a cheap Heltec Meshtastic node.  To duplicate my setup, you will need a Raspberry Pi with network capability running Meshtastic.  Then you can run meshtastic_bridge.py on it with your settings in config.json (you can use the same settings you have in config.c).  You will need to go through the trouble of setting the same cryptkey on all your nodes or your GPS-transmitting node will broadcast highly inaccurate GPS positions. (Before I knew this, I was getting unchanging positions roughly a mile and half away from where I actually was, and ChatGPT had no idea why but thought maybe I was swapping latitude and longitude. Yeah, that's a fail ChatGPT!)  When you do this, your mobile nodes in a Meshtastic mesh are just devices, identified by manufacture_id.  (Set manufacture_id to whatever the node's 64-bit unique address is when creating a device in the device editor.) This allows the device_id to be looked up and for logged data to be connected to it.  Meshtastic devices capable of sending text messages (most with displays can, though the ones with one-button GUIs only send canned messages) will have any messages received by meshtastic_bridge inserted into the message table, whose contents can be viewed from the message tab.  And any messages inserted into the message table using the web admin tool that have not been broadcasted on the LoRa mesh will be broadcasted in a timely fashion (within a minute).

## Graphical Data
Using Chart.js 3.7, data from the weather sensors can be viewed at /index.php in your server's web installation.  These graphs can display either multiple  types of data from one device or multiple locations of one type of data. Thus, for example, you can display temperature, pressure, and humidity from one location (device) or temperature from five different devices. The graphs can show different time ranges and you can page back into their history.  The same is also true with solar inverter data (if you have any to log) at /energy.php, and graph also features multiple color-coded timelines supermimposed on the energy data to show when various controllable device_features were turned on or off as well as what the prevailing weather conditions at the time were for the tenant's GPS coordinates. I will probably be adding support for paging data in this way to graph-generating reports as well.   

In the weather data display there is also a button that will cause data from precisely a year before the timeframe of the graph being displayed to also be displayed in a fainter color on the same graph, thereby providing the viewer a sense of how the contemporary period compares to that same period a year before.  This is useful for seeing if some insulated place with a large thermal mass (such as a basement) is ahead of or behind the changes of temperatures from the year before, thereby giving a sense of how on-target heat storage is.  

As parameters are changed on the pages showing weather and inverter graphical data, the url is changed accordingly, providing urls that can be saved for a return to a future version of the very same display.

![alt text](weathergraph.jpg?raw=true)

## Maps

There is also a Maps tab to display devices with device_log data containing varying GPS coordinates that can be plotted on a map. Any device with a can_move set to 1 can be viewed in Maps.  The plotted map points are broken up according to the same start date and timespan picker used by the graphing tabs and you cam mouse-over the points for detailed information collected from the device at that moment.

![alt text](maps.jpg?raw=true)

## Automation and Conditions
There is also an inverter-related endpoint in server.php to return live inverter information to the local remote (for now, this only works with SolArk inverters, as that is the kind I have, though they are notoriously hard to get data from).  This inverter data is also available to a conditions-processing system that automatically turns device_features on or off depending on inverter sensor values.  Such conditions are entered in the table management_rule in the conditions column.   Conditions include tokens that take the form <tablename[location_id].columnName>.  An example token would be <inverter_log[].battery_percentage>.  A condition made with that token would be something like

<inverter_log[].battery_percentage> > 80

which would set the connected device_feature's value to the value of management_rule.result if the condition is met and allow_automatic_management in the device_feature record is true.  Multiple management_rules can be added to device_features in the device_feature editor, which looks like this:

![alt text](devicefeature.jpg?raw=true)

Management_rules can be edited in the management_rule editor, which looks like this:


![alt text](managementrule.jpg?raw=true)

At the bottom is a tool you can use to automatically construct a value token to place in conditions.  Treat these as variables in an expression to be evaluated as true or false.  You can use multiple tokens, parentheses, arithmatic operators, and scalar numbers in such expressions.
Since manual changes to the status of device_features are usually at odds with automation, whenever a manual change to a device_feature is made, automation is automatically suspended for restore_automation_after hours, starting at the instant of the manual change.

## Commands
The ESP8266 is responsive to commands sent via the serial line (at this time, though, this does not seem to work when WiFi is active). These commands can do things like reboot the ESP8266, display how much memory is available, send infra-red commands, get the amount of time since the last reboot or connection to WiFi, configure an I2C slave if there is one, and dump stored records from the FRAM if there is one.  If these commands are instead sent via the Instant Command tool (reachable via the Utilities tab in the web app), then they are sent via the internet to the device specified in the device dropdown, that is, not via serial, and any responses from the command are sent back to that same window via the internet as well.  The command system, like the device_feature control system, has an inherent latency dictated by the polling rate of the ESP8266 (set in config.c, but also changeable via command), but it's fast enough for most debugging or control needs.  Example commands include **reboot**, **clear fram**, **dump fram**, **set date**, **get date**, **get memory**, **get uptime**, **set debug**,  and **clear debug**. There is also a database-backed system for sending commands that seems in retrospect like sort of a mis-step, but it's still there.

## Reports
The great thing about storing the data from your IoT devices in your own database is that you then have lots of ways to examine this data. If you're handy with SQL, then you can find data in any form you want it matching any criteria you can come up with.  With this in mind, I built an elaborate reporting system that allows me to save parameterized SQL queries and run them with forms to make entering the parameters easy.  Not only that, but every report you run is remembered in the report_history table, allowing you to re-run the report with the same parameters (or tweak the parameters as needed).  Reports are reached via the Reports tab, where the ones you've created (or that are created with your tenancy)  are listed. From there you can run or edit them. The core of every report is a SQL statement (or semicolon-separated sequence of SQL statements) that is run to produce one or more tables of data, graphs, or, in some cases, locations on a map.  They are defined as a form (represented in JSON and using the form description system used throughout the admin website), possibly an output configuration, an output template, and SQL. Simple reports can just be SQL, though if you need to send parameters to a report, you will need to define a form. And if you need your data presented a certain way, you will need an output_template. Perhaps forms definitions are best shown by example.

This JSON defines a form with one parameter
<code>
  [ {
	"label": "Which changer",
	"name" :"changerX",
	"type" : "select",
	"values": [
		"changer1", "changer2", "changer3", "changer4", "changer5", "changer6","changer7"
	]
	}]
</code>
the value of which is substituted into the SQL component of the report:
<code>

the "values" parameter in the form JSON can also be a SQL string to generate a list of options from the database.  If so, the SQL needs to return a 'text' column for a proper dropdown list of options to be displayed. (Obviously, anyone permitted to write such reports could wreak a lot of havoc with malicious SQL placed here to drop tables, etc.  With great power comes at least some responsibility, God!) A log of each report that is run is kept, and each log item is accessible via the web UI with enough information to allow it to be re-run with the same set of parameters as the original run.

Here is the JSON for a report that can generate two different graphs ("good graph" and "better graph" will appear in the output format dropdown as options, in addition to options for HTML and CSV):

<code>
{
  "output": [{
    "name": "good graph",
    "labelColumn": "recorded",
    "colors": "ff0000,00ff00,0000ff",
    "color": "ff0000,00ff00,0000ff",
    "plots": [
      {

This report presents a dropdown for how many days into the past to show a graph of current temperature and hot water temperature proxy data (stored in reserved4 in device_log) coming from (by default) an ESP8266 with a thermistor running to a nearby hot water tank:

<code>
{
  "output": [
    {
      "name": "Line Graph",
      "labelColumn": "recorded",
      "plots": [
        {
          "column": "reserved4",
          "color": "orange",
          "label": "hot water temperature proxy",
          "lineWeight": 1,
          "value": 4,
          "shape": {
            "radius": 1.4
          }
        },
        {
          "column": "temperature",
          "color": "red",
          "label": "temperature",
          "lineWeight": 1,
          "shape": {
            "radius": 1.4
          }
        },
        {
          "column": "humidity",
          "color": "blue",
          "label": "humidity",
          "lineWeight": 1,
          "shape": {
            "radius": 1.4
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "form": [
    {
      "name": "device_id",
      "type": "select",
      "values": "SELECT device_id, name as text FROM device WHERE tenant_id=  &lt;tenant_id/&gt;  ORDER BY name",
      "value": 4
    },
    {
      "name": "days",
      "label": "since __ days ago",
      "type": "select",
      "value": 6,
      "values": "1...15"
    }
  ]
}
</code>

The SQL for that report looks like this:

<code>	
SELECT (reserved4 /40) -10 as reserved4, temperature, humidity, recorded
  FROM device_log
    WHERE device_id=&lt;device_id/&gt; AND recorded > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL &lt;days/&gt; DAY) ORDER BY recorded ASC
</code>

Note that for a parameter form to be produced for a report, there must be "form" node in the JSON in addition to the "output" node.

This system can accept multi-line SQL separated by semicolons, in which case it will produce multiple interactive data grids on the screen (or a .zip file of .csv files if you are producing CSVs).  To tell the system how to label the results of the individual lines of SQL, you can include a single-line SQL comment ("--COMMENT") above each line and those comments will be used for filenames, on-screen labels, or even object names to pull data from when producing templated reports from complex multi-SQL-line queries that produce more than one recordset (try that in Crystal Reports!).  You can also set these sql captions as sqlCaption parameters to direct the correct data to the correct output specified in JSON if you want to produce multiple graphs or a mix of graphs, data grids, and maps.



Obviously there is a lot of power in such a system, since, depending on MySQL user permissions, a report-writer might be given access to any data on the database server;  only fully trusted users should get access to report creation and some reports are too powerful for anyone but users with the role 'super' to run.  Currently only 'super' users can create and edit reports, though, depending on the role given to a report, less-powerful users may be able to run it.  It's also possible to write reports that give enormous power to users, and such reports should be restricted (via role) to 'super.'

I asked ChatGPT to compare my reporting system with Crystal Reports (which I am unfortunately having to work with at a new job) and it came out with this handy comparison:

## Security

ESP8266s have limited memory, so I don't bother with making their polling happen via https.  Some data is deeply personal, such as your email, bank records, or the particular web sites you visit.  I do not consider weather data personal, so I do not chew off my fingernails fretting about sending the values of sensors in plaintext over the open internet.  I do, however, worry about pranksters getting the information about my backend and then polluting my database with bogus data or sending state orders to my remote control relays to switch device_features on or off contrary to my wishes.  So each ESP8266 sends an encrypted authentication secret with every poll of the server, and this has to be correct for the server to log data or perform remote control tasks.  I did not feel comfortable sending the secret in plaintext over http, so I encrypt it using a configurable algorithm (much simpler and using much fewer resources than https) that can take into account information about the plaintext data.  That way the secret is <em>also</em> encrypted and can't be used to send other data. Since a timestamp can be a factor in the encryption (which is configured via encyryption_scheme), the URLs can be made to expire.  Crypotographers may laugh at my scheme, but it protects my data and my remote control against casual prankster attacks.  (If North Korea decides that filling my database with million-degree temperatures is an important goal of the state, they could probably do this even if I used https.)

The actual website with all the tools to view data and control ESP8266s should be hosted on https, since otherwise password and cookie data is sent to the server in plaintext, allowing someone with access to that data (very few people) to view or alter it (unlikely).  Personally, I am not particularly concerned about such issues.  But if you don't understand the risks, you should probably host this site in https (while also allowing the ESP8266 to communicate over http).  If you do serve the site via https, make sure not to direct all http traffic to https, since server.php still needs to be reachable by http.

I've been gradually changing the nature of the secrets sent from the ESP8266s, making them more and more secure over time and changing the name of the actual key sent depending on how it is encrypted.

## Future Features
As of late August, 2025, all of the essential (and many of the nice-to-have) features had been implemented. The one big feature that I would like to build out is one where the .ino files used to generate ESP8266 (and perhaps other) firmware would be templateized so that they could be flexibly produced. (Currently all ESP8266s in this system receive the same firmware, with the only differences being configuration.) I eventually want to build an application to populate these templates, do the code compilation, and flash to the microcontrollers, completely bypassing the Arduino IDE.  This would give this system the core functionality of the ESPHome project, though it would have some advantages due to the database at its core and its use of GUIs providing classic feature discoverability.
